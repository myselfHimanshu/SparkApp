## Analytics Example -- Gradient Descent

In this exercise you will develop a distributed gradient descent algorithm for linear regression. This exercise uses a subset of the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.
